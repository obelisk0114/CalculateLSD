Calculate Fisher Least Significant Difference

# Introduction
A friend of mine needed to gain Fisher Least Significant Difference for his master thesis.
Therefore, I implemented a little program that helped my friends, YL, to calculate Fisher Least Significant Difference (LSD).

# How to Use it
You will need to enter a series of numbers and degree of freedom to calculate LSD.
I used space to split different numbers.

# Result
The program will give you the following statistical value.

1. Sum; 2. Average; 3. Population Variance; 4. Sample Variance; 5. Population Standard Deviation; 6. Sample Standard Deviation; 
7. Mean squared error(Mean); 8. LSD
